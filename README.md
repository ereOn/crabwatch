A guide to building a Rust &amp; Raspberry Pi-based open-source monitoring
station.

## Scope & Goals

There are multiple goals to this repository:

1. This project allows me to unify all my hobbies (electronics, programming, woodworking) into one realization.
2. It allows me to learn, discover and practice new things like ARM no-std cross-compilation of Rust, low-level hardware protocols (SPI, GPIO, I2C, ...).
3. Getting, in the hand a functional and useful monitoring station that I can hook-up to my job's services monitoring stack.
4. Sharing my discoveries and progress in the hope that it helps or inspires someone else!
5. Having fun!

## Organization

This repository is organized in different sections. Here is an overview of the
layout:

- The [Resources](./resources/) folder contains interesting resources that
  helped me while designing and researching everything. Check it out if you
  ever need to dig deeper than what I've done on some aspects!
