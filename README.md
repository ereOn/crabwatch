A Rust &amp; Raspberry Pi-based open-source monitoring station.

## Scope & Goals

There are multiple goals to this repository:

1. This project allows me to unify all my hobbies (electronics, programming, woodworking) into one realization.
2. It allows me to learn, discover and practice new things like ARM no-std cross-compilation of Rust, low-level hardware protocols (SPI, GPIO, I2C, ...).
3. Getting, in the hand a functional and useful monitoring station that I can hook-up to my job's services monitoring stack.
4. Having fun!
