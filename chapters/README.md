# Chapters

This is the main guide which tracks the progress of the project. Each chapter
is designed as a standalone guide that focuses on a specific aspect of the
project.

The chapters are meant to be read in order, but you can jump to a specific
chapter if you are interested in a particular topic.

## Requirements

This guide assumes that you are running on a Windows machine with
[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and that you are
at least somewhat familiar with a Unix-like environment.

If you intend to follow along with a different setup, for example a Linux or
Mac OS machine, you may have to adapt some details. That being said, as most of
the work will be done on the Raspberry Pi, the differences should be minimal.

For the coding part, you may want to use a modern IDE like [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I personally use
[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) but I won't go into the details of setting it up
here. This should not matter at all for the project.
